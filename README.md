Both Funtions takes as an input:
- an augmented matrix of the system
- a vector of initial approximations for all unknowns
- a tolerance threshold
- a parameter for choosing a stopping criterion (MAE or RMSE)

The programs will output:
- the vector of roots found
- the number of iterations it took to find them
